## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

This is an Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree project. I chose the dataset containing the stats of players from my favourite football club, Chelsea. 

I am really interested to gain a more data centric understanding of my club's season. 

My key questions are
1. Who are the most over-performing and under-performing goalscorers in the squad?
2. Which player is the most unlucky creative player in the squad?
3. Which player has the best minutes to goal ratio?

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

ChelseaStats.csv contains the data that I have used. It contains several metrics of the entire Chelsea sqaud of 2020-21. 

There is also a notebook available here to showcase all my work related to my three questions.



## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://samuelvarkey8.medium.com/analysis-of-the-chelsea-squad-for-the-2020-21-premier-league-season-a7b38176bd41)
